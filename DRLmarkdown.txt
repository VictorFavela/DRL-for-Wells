field_env.py : General environment. Contains structure for agent to run on. 

Field2D.py : A 2-dimensional oil field. Has a rock class that defines properties of rocks and how they work when drilled. 

world.py : Reads in a text file version of the world and formats an array version of the file

world.txt : the text version of an oil field. world.py reads this file in

oilfield_env.py : Environment that most of the testing utilizes. This file calculates rewards, moves the drill, counts steps etc. 

OilField3D : Similar to Field2D.py. Adds in functionality for a third dimension. Has an updated rock class and methods to retrieve individual rocks in a three-dimensional field. 

readData.py : Reads in our created data and uses it to populate the oil well with values

Sample_Rendering.ipynb : Renders a visualization of the well and the drill's current position by showing how liquid values change with time

smallStructure : the fake data we created to populate the oil field

agent.py : Is the agent that trains on the environment and tries to achieve the maximum reward

checker.py : Ensures the environment the agent is running on is compatible with Open AI Gym guidelines

CustomEvalCallback.py : Evaluates the agents performance to track if it is learning from its training

model.py : Creates a tensorboard output of the agent's training to track its performance over time. 

setup.sh : Creates a directory to store the agent's best results
